# chessmasterhong.github.io - Jekyll-based Website

This was the source code for my [website](http://chessmasterhong.github.io), built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

However, I have moved on to recreating the website using other technologies. I have left the source here in the event if anyone wishes to use it for their own purposes in the future. If you found the materials in this repository useful, either in part or whole, a link back to [http://chessmasterhong.github.io](http://chessmasterhong.github.io) would be appreciated, but not required.

The full listing of attributions and technologies used in the creation of this website can be viewed [here](credits/index.html).
