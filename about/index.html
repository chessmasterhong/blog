<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>
    My programming experience started in 2006, when I self-taught PHP as my first programming language. Over time, I have learned several other programming languages, frameworks, and standard technologies. I have knowledge of PHP, JavaScript, C++, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and some Python.

<p>
    In regards to operating systems, I have experience with both Windows and Linux, having nearly two decades of Windows experience (95, 98, Vista, XP, and 7), as well as several years of Linux (Ubuntu, Arch, and CentOS). Currently, I switch between Windows 7 and Arch Linux on a day-to-day basis.

    Personally, I think programming is fun. The ability to solve problems and create solutions through code has always been fascinating to me. In my spare time, I am usually coding side projects or learning new technologies.

                <p>
                    Programming languages, in general, has always been interesting to learn. The design pattern of programming languages effect how one would go about solving a problem in that language. Different languages can have different solutions to solve the same problem. Even just the ability to solve problems by using code is fascinating.

                <p>
                    I have always been fond of computer games. Just like many others, I enjoy playing computer games (there, I admit it). Nowadays, I enjoy developing computer games. Game development is where ideas fly, where creativity meets code, and where code becomes a game.

                <h4>Chess</h4>
                <p>
                    If you haven't guessed it already (from this site's URL address), I love playing chess. I have been playing chess since third grade in elementary school, having participated in tournaments and earning several trophies along the way. I like chess for its ability to test one's strategical planning, descision making, and above all, patience.
